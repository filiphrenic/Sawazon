DOESN'T WORK

I probably won't use it, because there's to much to implement.
If I understand correctly, I need to manually parse php and than execute logic in the templater
  because now it only works when inserting strings. foreach wouldn't work because array would be
  turned into 'Array'...

Now i'll have to write html inside php classes .................... F*ck
